# Fitness-Survey
A repository containing the material belonging to the Survey Fitness done as a project serving as the climax of the 1 module.
- We prepared an online survey using Google Forms, collecting information about the fitness habits of the members of our cohort, more precisely about the fitness regimes, dietary preferences and exercise frequency and intensity.
- The link to the survey was posted on slack, and 12 responses were anonimously collected.
- The collected data was exported to Google Sheets, and out of it, graphs were created using functions and tools, and different statistical measures ( like i.e. mean, variance, and standard deviations) were applied to the values, to make more sense out of them.
- The graphs were then exported and inbedded into a Google Slides presentation, together with an explanation text, and some extra graphics
- Lastly the findings were presented to the class, and discussed together
